This project focuses on analyzing Netflix's userbase data to gain insights into revenue generation across various dimensions. The dataset includes key columns such as subscription type, the device for which the subscription was taken, revenue generated by different countries, and revenue distribution across gender groups. Using Python, I performed data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to identify trends and patterns. The analysis aims to provide valuable insights for optimizing subscription plans, device targeting, and understanding geographical and gender-based revenue contributions. This project utilizes popular Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
